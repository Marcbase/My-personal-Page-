 <h1>Hi!<br> My name is Marius Bontea</h1><h1>and this is a short story about me and my passion for coding</h1></div>
    <br>
    <br>
  <div class="text">I am originally from Romania and have lived in the United Kingdom since 2014, primarily working in delivery and warehouse management. <br>I graduated from <strong>HND Computing at the Icon College of Technology and Management</strong>, and I am currently studying BSc (Hons) Computing - IT and Engineering at Falmouth University. <br>I am enthusiastic about music, technology, and art. I want to learn to code to gain new skills and, as a result, find work in the field.<br>
    <br>
 I’ve always dreamed of becoming a professional developer and helping companies develop their businesses. Also, I want to become an experienced developer because of the high pay rates.<br> My passion for coding started when I began to study Computing at Icon College. <br> Since then, I have developed my love for Programming while using different coding tools and languages such as Python and C#. <br>
 I believe there is no better place to continue my professional developer skills than the CodeYourFuture Campus. <br> I consider it an emotional experience to get the opportunity to meet students from all over the world and share their coding knowledge by learning together.<br> Hence courses like application development and programming would give me more insight into how businesses are affected in the world today by many other factors aside from Computing. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Regarding how much effort I’m willing to put in during this course, well, as much as possible. I would like to put my 100% into my studying. <br>I think studying is really important in my life. Education cannot really be neglected and should be given top priority for students.<br> It is an investment that my future relies on. Because of this, I always put my all into my studies.
    <br>
    I consider that my Pearson BTEC Level 5 Higher National Diploma in Computing achieved with Merit makes me eligible for the CodeYourFuture program. <br>I feel I am qualified for this program because of my dedication to the industry and my record of high achievement. Aside from being a driven professional,<br> I also enjoy encouraging strong bonds within the workplace or on-campus campus, which helps everyone look forward to coming to work or studying each day.
